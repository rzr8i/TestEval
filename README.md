# TestEval

#### Notes:
- Student files and `Base.txt` (the file containing exam's correct answers) should be placed in `data/` directory.
- Student files name should be in this format:
 - 1-9 students: `file1.txt` to `file9.txt`,
 - 10-99 students: `file01.txt` to `file99.txt`
 - etc...
- Each student file should consist of student name and their answers to each question in separate lines.
- Student files that have more/less answers than `Base.txt` will be ignored.
- Hash function that is used in hashing passwords is NOT secure.
